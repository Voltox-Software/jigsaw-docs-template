# Getting Started


## 1. Configuration
Configure your site name, URL, and other settings. Take a look at [how to configure](/docs/configuration) your site.

## 2. Add Content
All your documentation content is located in the `docs` directory. Jigsaw supports a variety of [file types](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/content-other-file-types/) for creating your content.

## 3. Add assets
If you have any assets, they can be added to the `source/_assets/` directory, and Laravel Mix will process them when running `npm run local` or `npm run production`.
> The `logo.svg` should be replaced with your own logo.
