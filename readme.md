# Jigsaw Docs Skeleton

A Documentation skeleton built for Jigsaw.

## Installation
```bash
composer install
npm install
./vendor/bin/jigsaw build
npm run dev
```

> Tip to watch files and use Browsersync, run `npm run watch`

### Styles
While the goal of this skeleton is to provide a great starting point for others to extend, there are some Sass stylesheets provided in `source/_assets/sass/`. 

#### Documentation
All content is in `source/docs/*.md`. 

#### Navigation
To easily manage navigation and URLs, a `navigation.php` file has been added to the project root.
